		<p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fukushima nuclear disaster resurfaced this year as Japan began spewing wastewater into the Pacific. And there are, of course, many, many opinions about a nation surrounded by other nations spewing potentially toxic, radioactive liquids into an ocean that connects the entire world. Critics point to the lack of evidence and scientific studies on the safety of tritium, the radioactive substance most worrisome in the waste. Advocates like to point to the allegedly comprehensive tests done by Japan, TEPCO, and the IAEA and the corresponding numbers from the WHO and other organizations. But there&rsquo;s a far more pressing, immediate issue than the potential contamination the world may face in decades. Fishermen, divers, and other laborers whose entire way of living, livelihoods, and knowledge revolve around working in and making money from the Pacific are facing immediate losses as those worried about the safety of seafood and other oceanic products move away.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China has already banned Japanese seafood, and protests in Korea indicate that sea products will face heavy resistance in coming years. That means the two nations closest to the Fukushima plant will heavily oppose oceanic exports from Japan - more importantly, fishermen and divers in Korea and Japan have already testified that public trust in their products is waning. In Japan, the release procedure holds a scarce majority, at just over 50%. And once the Pacific&rsquo;s currents drive the wastewater toward California and the rest of the world, the over three billion people who rely on the ocean for their livelihood will be at risk of losing everything. To them, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether science says the water is dangerous - as far as the public is concerned, toxic nuclear waste is still a topic with little awareness in sentiment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be clear, the Japanese government has pledged long-term support for the fishing communities directly affected by Fukushima in the nation. But contamination of Pacific waters means that Korea, China, later Hawaii and the continental United States, then the rest of the Pacific nations will all be hit by that same wave of negative public sentiment. Already, citizens in Hong Kong have flocked to sushi restaurants to get a last bite in before their seafood ban kicks in. And in Japan, despite that promise of support, there&rsquo;s a near-unanimous animosity among those who work on the ocean.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more, the fact that the studies and reports stemming from the Fukushima plant contain numbers best characterized as dubious means that global distrust over the issue won&rsquo;t be easily resolved. Although some countries, like France, continue to praise Japan on their transparency throughout the process, many detractors continue to note that the most critical report, issued by the IAEA, is very likely biased or represents a fallacious situation. Scientists at the University of Hawaii and other institutions claim, on record, that the potential effects of nuclear waste on the Pacific are understudied. And though the wastewater is diluted, the very concept of dilution - that of the danger still remaining, simply at a smaller scale - is a key factor in scaring the public off of sea products.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important comparison to make here is that of Fukushima to other nuclear disasters, like Chernobyl. Chernobyl&rsquo;s cleanup is still ongoing, and projected to take a total of nearly a century. Walls have been reinforced, the government has taken caution, and most importantly, no one has dumped nuclear waste into the bare world for all to eat. And while there is an argument to be made about the effects of Chernobyl compared to Fukushima - notably, the significantly larger number of long-term illnesses reported thus far - Chernobyl was also a disaster on a scale approximately ten times larger. Moreover, the difference in time period indicates that not only was data collected over a significantly longer period, it was collected during decades in which medical and nuclear technology were miles behind where we are now.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why is it that the Japanese government, head of a nation with capital and technology far outpacing that of 20th century Ukraine, felt the need to dump their byproducts after only a decade? And why is it that after an entire decade, that same government concluded that all other measures, like storing the waste underground, were infeasible despite those measures being used in other nuclear disasters throughout history? Is it because the Fukushima plant is an anomaly among nuclear plants? Or is it because they couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to protect the income, lives, and futures of a third of the entire world?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s an environmental point to be made here, about the dangers of releasing less-researched substances into the world. But even more important, even more urgent, even more immediate is that whether the science says the water is safe or not, and whether or not the government claims it&rsquo;s all political, there are real people at stake here. People whose entire lives rely on the already volatile global demand for seafood. Lives, three billion of them, that could come to an abrupt and tragic end. Stop eating seafood if you want. Stop buying from the Pacific. But remember the people - and remember what happens when the government stops caring about them.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Fukushima Daiichi Treated Water Release &ndash; Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) | IAEA.
