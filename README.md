# Hwalgi
Empowering student voices
## Technical Details
Hwalgi was initially a personal blog, but as I worked on it, I found myself interested in a more curated public forum.  
Much of the backend of this site is actually done through Google Forms and Google Sheets - the submission form is a reverse engineered Google Form endpoint that then places data in a spreadsheet with some controls for me to approve/disapprove essays and tag them before publishing to the site automatically.
