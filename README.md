# Hwalgi
Award-winning, unflinching, uncompromised opinions.
## Technical Details
The site is really simple - I wanted to go serverless and host everything as a static site, but I didn't want to have to write every essay in html or markdown (especially since I already have a backlog of prewritten pieces).  
Thankfully, Google Docs has a great export to html feature. The output file is a little bloated and has some styling that I don't want, but that can be removed with some very basic python code. Add a thumbnail, programatically modify the landing page, and you've got a nice little site.
