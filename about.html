		<h2>Hello.</h2>
		<p>Hwalgi is a passion project - an effort to give a voice to the people who will soon be the next generation of voters, legislators, and decision-makers.</p>
		<h2>Pen x Paper</h2>
		<p>As much as streamed media encroaches on written mediums, comic books replaced by animated shows and novels by TV shows, critical essays still hold an important place in society.</p>
		<p>You and I have the power to incite change through keystrokes. Think about that - we can bend the world using nothing but our words. That's an incredible prospect, and one that we must keep exploring.</p>
		<h2>You, Me, and the Rest of Us</h2>
		<p>But Hwalgi isn't a blog. It isn't one man writing alone in a dark room. It's a collective effort among students everywhere, saying what needs to be said.</p>
		<p>So go! Submit your writing - we want to hear your opinion, amplify it. We're not politically affiliated, so send us whatever you've got.</p>
		<p>We won't publish hate speech or misinformation, but everything else is fair game.</p>
		<h2>Tomorrow - or the Day After</h2>
		<p>Hwalgi doesn't end here: there are so many things we want to do in the future. Imagine a weekly newsletter that carriers <i>our</i> voice everywhere. Imagine a print publication that sits in a dentist's office for anyone to see. Imagine workshops to help young writers become catalysts for change.</p>
		<p>We can't wait for the future - but right now, our focus is on now.</p>
		<h2>The Serious, and the Not-So-Serious</h2>
		<p>But we aren't just a no-frills website with no fluff; send us your dog stories and your dating advice columns. We're here to be the megaphone for students - and students wouldn't be students without all those things.</p>
