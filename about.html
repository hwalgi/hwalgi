		<h2>What is Hwalgi?</h2>
		<p>Hwalgi is an online publishing platform for student-written op-eds, run and edited by students. We take your
			submissions, review them, and help prepare them before publishing them on our website with over a million
			annual visits and thousands of individual readers daily.</p>
		<h2>Why Submit?</h2>
		<p>Words spoken by students often fall on deaf ears. Hwalgi helps with that in two ways:</p>
		<h3>Editing</h3>
		<p>We edit your essays to make them more digestible and compatible with the widest audience possible.</p>
		<p>Students have raw, powerful voices; sometimes, that means student writing can come off as brusque or unyielding.</p>
		<p>We help you publish writing that does more than just opine: we want you to actually convince people to consider what you're saying.</p>
		<h3>Audience</h3>
		<p>Hwalgi brings the audience <i>to you</i>. Instead of struggling to attract readers, you can focus on what you do best: writing.</p>
		<h2>What about my resume?</h2>
		<p>We know that as students, you face pressure to always do the things that make your resume look good. In that vein, Hwalgi will award volunteer hours for any article we publish, and we'll issue you a citable DOI as well.</p>
		<p>As a bonus, we'll also provide a digital certificate for your work, so your efforts can be recognized.</p>
		<h2>What if I'm not politically aligned with the content on Hwalgi?</h2>
		<p>Hwalgi is not a partisan platform. That doesn't mean we won't publish political op-eds: political pieces comprise the majority of our catalog. Instead, we won't deny publication because our editors disagree with what you're saying.</p>
		<p>If there's a trend in the political leaning of the content of our sight, that doesn't reflect the opinions of our editors or anyone else at Hwalgi.</p>
		<p>As long as you aren't submitting hate speech, misinformation, or content that disparages specific individuals, we'll take a look at whatever you want to say.</p>
