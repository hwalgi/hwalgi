		<h2>Hello.</h2>
		<p>Hwalgi is a passion project - an effort to give a voice to the people who will soon be the next generation of voters, legislators, and decision-makers.</p>
		<h2>Pen x Paper</h2>
		<p>As much as streamed media encroaches on written mediums, comic books replaced by animated shows and novels by TV shows, critical essays still hold an important place in society.</p>
		<p>You and I have the power to incite change through keystrokes. Think about that - we can bend the world using nothing but our words. That's an incredible prospect, and one that we must keep exploring.</p>
		<h2>You, Me, and the Rest of Us</h2>
		<p>But Hwalgi isn't a blog. It isn't one man writing alone in a dark room. It's a collective effort among students everywhere, saying what needs to be said.</p>
		<p>So go! Submit your writing - we want to hear your opinion, amplify it. We're not politically affiliated, so send us whatever you've got.</p>
		<p>We won't publish hate speech or misinformation, but everything else is fair game.</p>
		<h2>Tomorrow - or the Day After</h2>
		<p>Hwalgi doesn't end here: there are so many things we want to do in the future. Imagine a weekly newsletter that carriers <i>our</i> voice everywhere. Imagine a print publication that sits in a dentist's office for anyone to see. Imagine workshops to help young writers become catalysts for change.</p>
		<p>We can't wait for the future - but right now, our focus is on now.</p>
		<h2>Imprints</h2>
		<p>Hwalgi is for every student, writing about every thing. But any platform also needs focus. So this main site, which you're on right now, is for academic writing. If you wrote an essay about politics, or science, or literature: we'll publish it here.</p>
		<p>Otherwise? We'll publish it in an imprint - a branch of Hwalgi that's hosted on its site with a focus on a non-academic field. Imprints serve two purposes: they allow us to publish pieces that may not be the right fit for Hwalgi, but they also allow us to fund the work we do on Hwalgi. Imprints are ad-supported, which means they'll generate revenue that we'll use to expand and improve Hwalgi as a whole.</p>
		<small>Hwalgi is fiscally sponsored by The Hack Foundation (d.b.a. Hack Club), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit (EIN: 81-2908499). </small>
