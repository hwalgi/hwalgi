These boys are Boy Scouts - and though they don&rsquo;t know it, they&rsquo;re being exploited for some fast cash. It&rsquo;s a complex and multilayered problem - one tangled in insurance, taxes, and legality.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy Scout popcorn bags are usually between 8 to 16 ounces and are sold door-to-door, in front of grocery stores, and, occasionally, on the side of the road. The Trail&rsquo;s End website - BSA&rsquo;s popcorn brand - sells them for anywhere between 25 to 30 dollars and advertises that these sales generate about 20 dollars for Scouts per bag. The discrepancy occurs when you look at the profit margin - when bought in bulk, a 50-pound bag of Pop Weaver popcorn (the brand that BSA buys its popcorn from) costs 34 dollars. That equates to 4 and a quarter cents - not dollars, cents - per ounce. For an 8-ounce bag, that means it costs 34 cents to make, while a 16-ounce bag costs 68. That means that each bag is virtually complete profit - very little of which, in fact, goes to the Scout.</span></p><p class="c4 c1"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 20-dollar figure is generated, according to the website, from the &ldquo;Trail&rsquo;s End Return to Scouting&rdquo;, but that calculation can&rsquo;t be found or verified anywhere. It&rsquo;s also important to note that those 20 dollars don&rsquo;t go directly to the Scout. They&rsquo;re split up between the Scout&rsquo;s local council, troop, and account - the account only receiving about 12 percent, or about 2 dollars and 40 cents. So, in total, a Scout, having done all the marketing, sales, and physical labor, receives just over 2 dollars - that&rsquo;s compared to the anywhere between 5 to 10 dollars, or 25 to 50 percent, that BSA takes, about 6 dollars, or 30 percent, that the local council takes, and the 12 dollars, or 60 percent, that the troop takes.</span></p><p class="c4 c1"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorbell rings. Two girls, smiling and cheery, stand on the porch in crisp uniforms. They&rsquo;re offering cookies - Thin Mints and Tagalongs and Samoas. These girls are Girl Scouts - and they&rsquo;re toiling away to help fund leadership camps, volunteering efforts, and local troops. Girl Scout cookie revenue splits are hardly better than Boy Scouts - in fact, individual Scouts get no money at all. The difference, however, lies in the product and the profit. Girl Scout cookies cost significantly more to manufacture than popcorn, and operate at a significantly lower profit margin. A box of cookies, made by either ABC Bakers or Little Brownie Bakers, typically costs 1 dollar and 8 cents to make, and sells for anywhere between 4 and 7 dollars, depending on the local council. That&rsquo;s a far less extreme overhead at a more reasonable price - particularly for an arguably tastier product. Moreover, all net proceeds go directly to Girl Scout chapters, with none going to national accounts and only 6 percent goes to local council accounts. The rest goes to funding camps, leadership training, volunteer work, and 21 percent for troops.</span></p><p class="c4 c1"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a markedly obvious difference in funds raised too - during cookie season, Girl Scouts sells 800 million dollars&#39; worth of cookies. They beat out Oreos, Chips Ahoy, and other leading cookie brands, all while only selling for 6 to 8 weeks. They don&rsquo;t have a secret either - their cookies simply taste better than Boy Scout popcorn (and mulch), and they employ key marketing tactics to standardize their cookie stands. Their online platform allows those searching for cookies to know when and where they&rsquo;ll be available, while their door-to-door salesmanship is unmatched, with forms that - unlike Boy Scouts - don&rsquo;t involve guilt-tripping customers and instead simply list how funds raised will be used.</span></p><p class="c4 c1"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s not to say Girl Scout cookies are completely unproblematic - they still use palm oil, employ different bakeries for different regions and therefore produce different cookies for the same order, and a 0 percent revenue split for Scouts is still egregious. Regarding the palm oil, unlike other organizations that have shifted away from the substance, which is famous for being harvested in exploitative farms located in low-wage third-world countries, GSUSA has stood firm on its use of the savory ingredient. Both bakeries it employs have half-committed to &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; palm oil, but have made no backable promises in any form. Despite the blemishes on the surface of the cookie program, its underlying foundation is solid. It&rsquo;s a model that Boy Scouts could employ well.</span></p><p class="c4 c1"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while Girl Scouts may be partially complacent in the continued prevalence of palm oil, even worse is the reality of Boy Scout sales fueled partially by cheap incentive programs - Scouts are motivated with trinkets, tech, and gift cards to hit price ceilings far above the cost of those rewards. Although incentive programs are common in fundraising programs, Boy Scouts exacerbates the system&rsquo;s flaws by forcefully pushing incentives on both Scouts and their customers - fliers contain images of the highest-end rewards, as do order forms, the app, and the online ordering site.</span></p><p class="c4 c1"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see a similar pattern with mulch sales, but most egregious of all are coupons. The official Boy Scout planning handbook details the process of fundraising through &ldquo;council camp cards&rdquo; - collections of coupons sold by Scouts in place or as a supplement to popcorn. Councils get free coupons from businesses, then give them to units to distribute to individual Scouts. But while popcorn, though keeping the majority of profits from Scouts, gives almost 60 percent to troops for camping and other costs, camp cards give at most 50 percent (and usually far less) to the troop. In fact, the guide doesn&rsquo;t even say anything about individual Scout accounts.</span></p><p class="c4 c1"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there&rsquo;s more! The aforementioned guide not only details exorbitant revenue splits, but also prohibits Scouts from getting any money at all. Any money given to Scouts comes from troops or councils going against that. That restriction is coming from the same organization that markets its popcorn as donating money &ldquo;to Scouts&rdquo; and can attribute most of its profit to language that implies a direct pipeline to Scout accounts. Their reasoning is simple - the IRS prohibits it. But that&rsquo;s exactly it - the IRS doesn&rsquo;t. The tax law clause that the guide refers to simply states that fundraising events can&rsquo;t be &ldquo;organized or operated for the benefit of private interests&rdquo;. That means that fundraisers can&rsquo;t generate funding purely to be filched. It does not mean that fundraised money can&rsquo;t go to individual Scout accounts - Scout accounts can only be used in Scouting activities, like paying for camping and food.</span></p><p class="c4 c1"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more cynical reader may ask where the profit generated by BSA goes. Campsites? Training? New activities and services? No. Executive salaries - in 2019, Michael B. Surbaugh, president of BSA, received over 1.1 million dollars in compensation. Compare that to just barely over 0.2 million dollars for the Girl Scout CEO and under 0.7 million for the CEO of the Red Cross, a multinational humanitarian organization. Combine that with 720,000 dollars for the Treasurer and around 2.5 million dollars for four different civil engineers, and you&rsquo;ve got over 4 million dollars blown. In total, BSA spent 79 million dollars in compensation and another 30 million dollars on legal work and consulting, burning through a quarter of its total revenue.</span></p><p class="c4 c1"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, Boy Scout popcorn isn&rsquo;t even infamous for being bad - no one knows it exists. Doubling down on that issue is a lack of brand unity. BSA sells popcorn, pretzels, mulch, coupons, jerky, peanuts, and coffee, none of which is remotely tasteful nor reasonably priced. Girl Scouts? Their cookies are ubiquitous and delicious, famous not for melting on porches but for melting in mouths. The difference is obvious when you look at finances - Boy Scouts filed for bankruptcy and owes 2.8 billion dollars (with a B) to sexually abused members, while Girl Scouts is over 200 million dollars in the positive. In recent years, Boy Scouts has lost 12 million dollars annually, while Girl Scouts profited 20 million.</span></p><p class="c4 c1"><span class="c2 c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s a lot to be said about the problems that surround Boy Scouts as an organization, as a cultural phenomenon, and as an ideology. But what&#39;s undoubtedly true, reaffirmed for years, is that fundraising in the now rapidly declining non-profit needs to change. Exploitative revenue sharing and dangerous incentive programs should never have existed in the first place, but at the very least, it&#39;s time for them to take a bow and leave center stage. It&#39;s time for a new play.</span></p><p class="c4 c1 c10"><span class="c2 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">About Girl Scout Cookies | Girl Scouts. (n.d.).
