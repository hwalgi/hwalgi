        <h2>Why Submit?</h2>
        <p>Hwalgi is a platform for <i>your</i> voice. Put yourself out there!</p>
        <p>And don't worry, the work you do will be rewarded - you're awarded volunteer hours based on the number of hours you report*.</p>
        <p>There are so many people out there who want to hear your voice. They may not know it yet, but you could be the person that changes their view, convinces them to vote, tells them about something new.</p>
        <p>We need a voice - but we can't afford to wait.</p>
        <p>Be the voice.</p>
        <small>* within reason</small>
        <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
        <p class="sflp">To submit a piece, please scroll down to the </p><a href="#subForm" id="sfl">submission form</a><p class="sflp">.</p>
        <h3>Age</h3>
        <p>To submit a piece, you must be currently attending middle school, high school, or be between the ages of 10 and 19.</p>
        <h3>Title</h3>
        <p>Your title should be two parts, each of which has its own field in the submission form. <i>Topic</i> is what you're writing about - this can be a societal event, a political concept, an organization, etc. Most topics will be proper nouns. <i>Subtitle</i> is the subtext seen under topics in the Feed. Your topic and subtitle, when put together in the "topic... subtitle" format, should form a complete clause.</p>
        <p>After you submit your piece, we may rephrase or rewrite your title during the editorial process. However, your piece will not be published with changes before we receive your consent.</p>
        <h3>Contents</h3>
        <p>Hwalgi does not publish hate speech, discriminatory language, harmful rhetoric, personal attacks, or private information. All pieces submitted to Hwalgi may require changes if it is selected for publication.</p>
        <p>Hwalgi does accept letters-to-the-editor and reactions to other pieces published on Hwalgi. We do advise that you try to phrase any responses as comments before submitting them to be published, but a response with enough substance - that is, it adds to the conversation rather than simply rebutting or supporting a previous essay - may be accepted.</p>
        <h3>Word Count and Style Guides</h3>
        <p>We do not enforce any specific word count. The number of words you use does not determine the quality of your essay nor does it change the validity of your point.</p>
        <p>Our only requirements for style are that sentences are correctly capitalized (unless stylistically significant) and that there are sufficient line breaks. Essays that don't have enough paragraph breaks will not be immediately rejected, but we will ask that you add them before we publish.</p>
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>While we do attribute articles to their authors, we ask that you do not add explicit references to your school, your age, your address, or any other identifiable information in your submission.</p>
        <h3>Exclusivity and Plagiarism</h3>
        <p>Pieces published on Hwalgi do not have to be exclusive to Hwalgi. However, when you submit to Hwalgi, you guarantee that you are the original author of your piece AND that you have full rights to your piece.</p>
        <p>Any evidence of plagiarism found on Hwalgi will not only result in the removal of your submission from our site and an immediate rejection of any other submitted pieces, but may also result in your academic institution being notified.</p>
        <h3>Citations</h3>
        <p>We ask that you cite all of your sources in a standard, accepted format. There is no preference for a specific style guide, but you must include references at the end of your essay.</p>
        <p>Citing a source does not mean you can plagiarize from it. While all sources must be cited, a citation does not excuse blatant theft of intellectual property.</p>
